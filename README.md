# AssetTrackingMVC
<strong>Education exercise to learn about MVC.</strong>

The project is a start for an Asset Tracking Database. The aim is for a company to keep track of their assets (like laptops, phones, etc).
The presentation is a list of all the assets, which office they belong to, their cost, and with a marker for how close they are to their end of life. 

So far it is possible to
<ul>
<li>Show a list of assets and see their life span, office and cost</li>
<li>Add, edit and delete assets and offices.</li>
<li>Users register and login</li>
<li>Authorized users (admins) may change the database</li>
</ul>

The project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 - Version 17.2.4
